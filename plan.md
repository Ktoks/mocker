# this script is built to mock large data files based on a single line of input

# Architectural plan: ############

# input a file with one line on it(first)
# input a count of how many records to mock
# input keys for any columns that are not guessed by the code(first)
# output to the terminal(first)
# default behavior is to guess what each field represents (second)
# Input file with data on one line
# options put into command line are optional explanations of what each field is.

# If no explanation is input for each field, the code makes its best guess how to mock the field -based on length for Numbers, unless a decimal involved (assumed money).

# Example:
# Infile record= Mr. | Dave | Sharp | 435-586-0101 | dave.the.sharpener@gmail.com | Pencil Street | #2 | Woodshaft Pennsylvania, 02345 | 12k456789
# Cmd infile 1=t 2=f 3=fl 4=p 5=e 6=1b 7=h+1n 8=c 9=a9k3 -d |
